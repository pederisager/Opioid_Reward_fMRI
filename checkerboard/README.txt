Simple visual task designed to measure the potential effect of morphine on global BOLD signal.

log:

09.01.17
Initiated analysis based on new BETs
Old FEAT analyses put in folders for eventual deletion 

14.11.16
Incorporated three level analysis in Abel
Ran thirdlevel with autmatic outlier dewighting - Still no signal above threshold whole brain. 
Deleted some temp-folders and redundant files.

09.11.16 
Auto deweighting timed out (used more than 24 hours to complete). 
Deleted and resubmitted autodw_minus532 gfeat with doubled time limit.  

07.11.16
Put all MORvsPLA gfeats in common folder, to prevent clutter during analysis exploration. 
Ran MORvsPLA gfeat excluding 532 and turing on auto deweighting. 

14.10.16
Completed debugging of secondlevel-FEAT test script for Abel.
Updated main MORvsPLA_simple script.
Ran MORvsPLA_simple.fsf in abel. A repeated measure second level FEAT with default settings.  

10.10.16
Transferred firstlevel FEAT directories from ABEL
Renamed and edited some directories
Added a script for second level FEAT analysis on Abel

06.10.16
Created folder.
Created subfolders EVs, FEAT, fMRI_raw, scripts
Added rawdata
