#  INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY'S GIT REPOSITORY   #
#						       #
########################################################

INTRODUCTION

The entire Opioid_Reward_fMRI directory is stored as a
git repository, connected to github. This means that
previous versions of files can be stored and later 
retrieved. Even files that are now deleted.

However, there are only some files that are stored. 
You do not have to know how to use git to operate in
this directory, but make sure you read the rules below 
before doing work here.

########################################################

RULES

1) Do NOT DELETE the .git or the .gitignore directories.

2) Please store a report of your activity in
the appropriate README.txt at the end of the day, like 
this:
###############################
# DD.MM.YY		      #
# Ran analysis X, in folder Y #
# Created folder Z	      #
# Deleted folders A and B     #
# etc... 		      #
###############################
This information will be logged in git, and is the best 
way for others to navigate and understand the files that 
are available. This includes you in the future!

3) Everything you put in any "scripts" folder will be
saved in git the next time a version of the directory is
stored in git. Do not put large files, or a large number
of files, in these directories. Only scripts and files 
that are essential to those scripts.

########################################################
