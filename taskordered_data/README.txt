This folder contains behavioral data files from E-prime and Matlab, ordered by task. 

There were two computers used for testing (red and black and mrilab). 
Note that txt files from MATLAB are added from the last participant tested on either of the testing computers under the assumption that this file would also contain the data from all previous participants. This is not always the case however. 
If you cannot find the data for a given subject, you may find it helpful to check the txt file in that subjects folder in the backup_data/ directory.
