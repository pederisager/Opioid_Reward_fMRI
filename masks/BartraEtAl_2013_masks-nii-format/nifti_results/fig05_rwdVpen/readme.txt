Convention for coding the valence of SV effects: Each contrast was placed in one of 5 categories, labeled 1-5 as follows.
1: Smaller penalty vs. larger penalty
2: Neutral vs. penalty
3: Reward vs. penalty
4: Reward vs. neutral
5: Larger reward vs. smaller reward

The "Penalty" group includes categories 1 and 2 (files labeled "12"). The "Reward" group includes categories 4 and 5 (files labeled "45").
